Project Info

I choose to make the game mainly for patients recovering from stroke as they face many challenges regarding their motor skills and the
games we develop will help them in a speedy recovery in a fun and less painfull way. 
They require help in neuroplasticity as they sustain tissue damage from the stroke and will face difficulties throughout the process. 
Neuroplasticity will compensate for tissue damage sustained after stroke and can lead to improvement in functions that
were once impaired or lost.
